Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! The mobile repository follows the overall project contribution guidelines, with some additional instructions tailored to our workflow. Please read and follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

## Workflow

### Create a New Branch 
Begin by creating a new branch for the changes you intend to make. Each branch should correspond to a specific feature, bug fix, or update. Make sure to name your branch following this format: GitHub username or name/type of change/descriptive-name. This practice helps in maintaining a clear separation between your changes and the main branch until they are ready to be merged.

Example: `john-doe/feature/user-authentication`

### Make Your Changes
Once you've created a new branch, you can start making your desired changes to the codebase.

### Write Clear Commit Messages
It's essential to provide clear and concise commit messages for each of your commits. A well-explained message helps other contributors understand the purpose of your changes and streamlines the review process.

### Test Your Changes
Before submitting your changes for review, thoroughly test them to ensure they function as intended. This step helps in maintaining the overall quality of the codebase. Additionally, unit tests must be written and kept up to date.

### Create a Pull Request (PR)
When you believe your changes are ready for review, create a pull request from your branch to the main repository's branch. Include a detailed description of the changes you've made and the value they bring to the project.

### Participate in Code Reviews
After submitting a PR, be prepared to actively participate in code reviews. This may involve addressing feedback from other contributors, making necessary adjustments to your code, and responding to questions about your changes.

### Merge the Changes
Once your changes have undergone review and received approval, they can be merged into the main repository's branch. Only repository maintainers or owners should perform this final merge.

### Maintain Communication
Throughout the entire process, it's crucial to maintain open communication with fellow contributors. Respond to comments on your PR in a timely manner and keep everyone informed about any changes or updates related to your work.


## Guidelines
### Avoid Using AI Tools
Please refrain from adding AI-generated code, such as from tools like ChatGPT or Github Copilot, to the codebase. The only exception is for using AI to assist in developing unit tests and documentation.

### Coding Standards and Style
Follow the established coding standards and style guide for the project. Consistency in code formatting makes it easier for everyone to read and understand the code. If in doubt, refer to the project's documentation for coding guidelines.

### Modular Development
Encourage modular development by breaking down your changes into smaller, focused commits. This makes it simpler to review and understand individual changes, and it allows for easier debugging if issues arise.
